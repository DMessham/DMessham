### About Me
I am currently a student at SaskPolytech, in the Interactive Design & Technology Program. 
I am interested in making things that work on old devices.
### Why my activity graph looks weird?
The tools I use to push my changes aren't tied to my github account, or the email I used to make it.
Look at each repo individually to see my activity.
